# SWUtils
A Swift SWUtils kit. Util functions for Swift ... 
## Usage


Import SWUtils at the top of the Swift file with the content you would like.
```swift
import SWUtils
```

### Prerequisites

*The framework compiles on Swift 3.x or 4.x, but it can format programs written in Swift 2.x, 3.x or 4.x. Swift 2.x is no longer actively supported however, and newer rules may not work correctly with Swift 2.x. If you find that SWUtils breaks your 2.x codebase, the best solution is probably to revert to an earlier SWUtils release, or enable only a subset of rules.*

## Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:
```swift
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
